# Rust GUI test

I'm planning to use a GUI library for a application I'm writing.
The library has to be simple and customizable.

I've done my research, and concluded [Iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced) and [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) are good candidates.

## The criteria

- The application should run natively on all desktop platforms and on the web.
- It should have two round buttons without border, like Material Design.
- The buttons should toggle dark and light theme for the whole application.
- The buttons should say what they do on hover.
- Preferably, the buttons should be a icon (SVG) and not a font (since then I'd have to bundle a large font!).
- A text, "e^i + 1 = 0" with the correct elevation of "i".

## Results
TBC
